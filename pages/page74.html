    <h1>Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems for Complex Task Coordination</h1>
    <h2>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research | Vol. 79</h2>
    <p>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research introduces novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Algorithm enables autonomous robots to dynamically form coalitions and coordinate complex tasks without centralized control, demonstrating applications in warehouse automation and disaster response.</p>

    <p>Decentralized learning with communication protocols achieves 94% efficiency in collaborative tasks. Agents develop emergent strategies through shared reward structures, outperforming centralized approaches by 35% in dynamic environments. Real-world deployment in Amazon warehouses reduces package sorting time by 40%.</p>
