    <h1>Long-term Efficacy of mRNA Vaccines: Clinical Trial Results</h1>
    <h2>The New England Journal of Medicine | December 2024</h2>
    <p>The New England Journal of Medicine publishes comprehensive data on mRNA vaccine performance over 3-year period. Study includes 50,000 participants across multiple demographics, showing sustained immune response and minimal adverse effects.</p>
